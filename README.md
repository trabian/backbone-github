The purpose of this project is to extract Backbone models that can be
used to interact with the GitHub API.

It's currently being used primarily as part of [titanium-backbone-ks](https://github.com/trabian/titanium-backbone-ks) but will hopefully be improved to the point where it can be used in multiple contexts.
